# Metaboverse demo
- Click [here](https://metaboverse.github.io/demo/) to interact with a simple demo version of Metaboverse.
- Further documentation can be found [here](https://metaboverse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Demo data is derived from: [PR000305](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/DRCCMetadata.php?Mode=Project&ProjectID=PR000305)

- Note: Currently, ability to upload your own data is turned off until we finish ironing out some final details. Also, the expression/abundance <b>Pattern Search Engine</b> has not been incorporated into this demo yet, but will be in the near future.

<b>Features that will be included in version 1 of the tool (beta-release)</b>:
- User friendly interface, easy to use out of box
- Regulatory search engine: Find regulatory events that are pathway-naive
- Nearest neighbor search from metabolite/protein/gene of interest: See network-wide reactions and relationships that entity of interest is involved in (pathway-naive)
- Interactive pathway searches
- Multi-omic integration of user datasets
- Metabolic + other signaling networks
- Customizable network representations
